# OGL Framework

A single header library for opengl.
I often find myself experimenting on opengl concepts and everytime I want to try to implement somthing, I have to write boilerplate code that is not part of the experiment.
This library solves that issue. It's boiler plate code for opengl

## Demo

*Will add later when I have an interesting one*
  
## Features

- Shader createion
- Reloading shaders during runtime
- Setting uniforms (float, int, mat4 and vec3)
- Texture creation

More to come :)
